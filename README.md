# Task Scheduler

A powerful and user-friendly C++ application that helps you manage your tasks effectively. Stay organized, meet deadlines, and boost your productivity with this feature-rich task scheduler.

Key features:
- Create tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates/times
- Display all tasks in an easy-to-read format
- Edit task details as your plans change
- Delete tasks that are no longer needed
- Search tasks by title
- Mark tasks as complete (‚úîÔ∏è)
- Persistent storage using file I/O

This project was developed as part of my journey in learning C++, demonstrating skills in:
- Data structures (vectors)
- File I/O operations
- Struct usage for complex data types
- Switch statements for menu-driven interfaces
- String manipulation
- Date and time handling

This Task Scheduler project showcases my ability to create a practical, console-based application in C++. It demonstrates my understanding of fundamental programming concepts like data structures, file handling, and user interaction. The code is structured to be readable and maintainable, reflecting my commitment to clean coding practices.

As I continue to learn and grow as a developer, this project serves as a solid foundation, showing my ability to build useful tools to solve real-world problems. I'm excited to enhance this application further, possibly adding more advanced features like task prioritization, a GUI, or even mobile app integration in the future.

You can explore the code, provide feedback, or make this Task Scheduler even better. Together, we can create a tool that helps people stay organized and achieve their goals more efficiently. üìÖ‚ú®
